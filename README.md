# Python

This repository contains Python implementations of basic data structures and algorithms for educational purposes. Some of the algorithms in this repository could be optimized and some could be generalized. I will try to add as much algorithms as possible and make them as efficient as possible. The main goal is simplicity and readability of the solutions.
